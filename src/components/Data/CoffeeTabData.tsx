        Description: "An Americano is a coffee drink made by diluting a shot of espresso with hot water. This results in a beverage that has a similar strength to traditionally brewed coffee but with a unique, richer flavor profile. It typically features a strong, full-bodied taste with a smooth finish. The water-to-espresso ratio can be adjusted to taste, but it generally balances the intensity of the espresso while providing a lighter, more drinkable cup. An Americano is a favorite for those who appreciate the nuanced flavors of espresso without the thickness of a straight shot.",

        Description: "A latte is a popular coffee drink that combines a shot of espresso with steamed milk, topped with a small amount of milk foam. The result is a creamy, smooth beverage that highlights the rich flavor of the espresso while providing a velvety texture from the milk. Typically served in a larger cup or glass, lattes offer a mellow, milky taste with just a hint of coffee strength, making them a favorite for those who prefer a milder, more comforting coffee experience. Often, lattes are customized with flavored syrups like vanilla or caramel, and they can also be decorated with intricate latte art, adding a visual appeal to the delightful drink.",
